Yii2 SB Admin 2 Theme
=====================
A Bootstrap 4 admin template theme for Yii2

Installation
------------

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist johnsnook/yii2-sbadmin2 "*"
```

or add

```
"johnsnook/yii2-sbadmin2": "*"
```

to the require section of your `composer.json` file.

Minimum stability should be changed from 'stable' to dev
```
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
```
and

yii bootstrap should be changed to the bootstrap 4 version
```
        "yiisoft/yii2-bootstrap": "~2.1.0",
```

Usage
-----

The layout files should be copied from vendor/johnsnook/layouts to backend/views/layouts where you can modify them to your hearts content.

Obviously in progress, I started work on 4/3/2018.
